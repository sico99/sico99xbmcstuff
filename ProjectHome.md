# Sico99's Plugin & Script Repository #
## A place for me to host the XBMC Scripts and Plugins ##

Just a couple of really simple plugins probably of no use to anyone but me. If anyone does like CNET TV shows or Zero Punctuation hopefully these will be of some amusement.

I think someone wanted an icanhascheezburger plugin I know I did.

I have also made an ITN video viewer, a Wine TV Plugin, an XBOX Twitter Client and still in development is a script to display a guitar tab for the currently playing song from ultimate guitar tabs. At some point I hope to get these into a fit state to upload.
