#summary Explanation of the CNET Plugin

= Introduction =

The CNET TV Plugin was the first I made and allows a basic interaction with the CNET site. I started with just the complete list of videos available but it now includes most of the shows one the site.


= Features =

1.1 
  * Added Catagories and shows as lists in their own right
  * All shows also have a date to identify which is which when sorting by name
  * Added the Today on CNET playlist, seems to be working intermittently and not a playlist
  * Now has settings to choose the default bit rate so can always be in HD if you can play it 

1.0 
  * All CNET TV Videos available in list
